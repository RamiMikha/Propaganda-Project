                <h4>This poster invokes patriotic views firstly with the top line of the poster by saying “Join your glorious military” This helps to invoke the strong patriotic views citizens from the allied countries had towards their military. The image of the poster shows all the allied countries with the british flag putting them all together fighting for one cause and giving the group more pride. Then it can be seen at the beginning of the line near the bottom it says “to maintain honour” which shows the countries pride and honour in its government and military power. The poster then shows extreme with the old german flag and the austrian hungry empire flag with an x marking them, this makes citizen look down at those countries. The hatred is shown again by the line seen towards the bottom by exaggerating the evil acts done by germany, this shows that they were the ones responsible for the war when it reality it was the result of many countries actions. The poster uses guilt against its own citizens to recruit for the military. In order to achieve that goal, the line seen near the bottom of the poster states “fight against those that have no respect for peace” This technique puts guilt that for those that don't want to join by giving the idea if one does not fight they are allowing for the wrong doing of those against peace.</h4>
