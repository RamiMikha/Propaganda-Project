                <h4>This poster invokes patriotic feeling as the first line states “Protect and save your great country” This incites patriotic feelings in the reader as it reminds them of their country and how great it is. It helps to show what the citizens should be fighting for. Furthermore, it uses symbols such as the american flag, america flag colors and american soldiers. These symbols help to show what America should be and who they should be fighting for. The poster also creates an exaggeration of hatred towards the enemy and dehumanizes the Enemy who in this case is hitler as it references hitler as a demon and portrays him as a monster who deserves not to be treated as a human being but to die</h4>
