                <h4>The first poster seeks to exaggerate hatred towards the enemy by emphasizing the idea that the king wasn’t on France’s side as he betrayed France. However, the second poster conveys the idea that an empire should be followed and does this without mention of the opposing view. Both posters invoke patriotism as they both depict strong symbols in the France culture and show symbols that people should be fighting for. The symbols in the posters help to unite the citizens of France against the enemy.</h4>
