                <h4>Second poster shows a grave with a soldier helmet on top with the words “is your son next?” written on the grave. This is the opposite perspective from the created poster. The poster give the message that men are dying by going to war and for what reason? The created poster gives honour to the military and creates the sense that being in the military makes you an honourable man since the soldiers are seen to be walking powerfully with luxurious clothing. However this poster gives the idea that sending the countries sons to fight is not honourable but will only result in death which was the case for many men by the end of the war for almost all participating countries. The poster is most likely targeting moms with the goal to stop the many death occurring in war which the first poster almost shows as not possible. </h4>
