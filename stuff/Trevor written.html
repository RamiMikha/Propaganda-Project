                <h4>The main message of the image created was to recruit men to join the war against germany and it is doing so by dehumanizing Hitler. The poster shows hitler with a knife which creates a scene that he is a murderer which he is. However this Poster says the following words “Our last hope:Hitler” which gives the idea that in germany some see hitler like a great leader which is their chance to make Germany a great country after all the debt and humiliation that had received after World War 1</h4>
