                <h4>This post invokes patriotism as it depicts and emphasizes its message through the colors of the france flag. The poster furthermore tries to appeal to patriotic views of France as it presents the things that the third estates were fighting for(liberte, eligate, fraternite) wrapped around the eiffel tour in french colors. The poster also has the words “We are France” at the bottom. These words help to invoke a patriotic feeling as it reminds the citizens that they are the nation of France and consequently, they need to make the best decision for France. The sense of exaggeration of hatred towards the opposition is evident in this poster because it seeks to appeal to the citizens of France by guilting them as the poster reads “why follow a king who betrayed you”. It conveys to the citizens the notion that they shouldn’t follow the monarch but instead support the revolution </h4>
